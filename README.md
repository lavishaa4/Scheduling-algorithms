# Scheduling-algorithms
A collection of C programs implementing classic CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, Multi-Level Queue Scheduling, and the Banker's Algorithm. Each program demonstrates process scheduling logic, computation of Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT) with sample input and output.
